TODO: leaves

TODO: our model supports treating these as a cons-list of characters

TODO: (Place somewhere) This move semantics gives us a richer structure than

TODO: Traditional diff: no relation (and indent might change)

TODO: memory usage

TODO: cache eviction algorithm

TODO: Finally, note that through we present several complex scenarios, this is merely for presentation.
