The core components of a version control system are a patch language, a method for synthesizing patches from user actions, and an approach for merging patches. 
% Existing patch based systems such as Darcs~\cite{DBLP:conf/haskell/Roundy05} and Pijul achieve commutativity between patches in many cases, but Grove achieves total commutativity. 

% Grove stands out from existing systems in the precision of its patch language and the simplicity of its patch synthesis and merge processes, as well as its intrinsic guarantee of commutativity by employing a graph CmRDT as its repository data structure. 

% Patch languages vary in their native data structure and level of precision, with Grove's patch language being exceptionally fine-grained and molded to the language. Traditional patch synthesis algorithms reconstruct patches from version differences, while Grove uniquely synthesizes patches directly from edit actions. Traditional merge algorithms, such as those used by Git, employ operational transforms to

\subsection{Patch Languages}
There have been many different designs for patch languages and indeed many imperative data structures and their associated operations can be construed as patch languages in the most general sense. In the context of collaborative coding, patch languages can differ in the data structures they operate on (e.g. line-based text~\cite{DBLP:conf/haskell/Roundy05}, character-based text~\cite{DBLP:conf/sigmod/EllisG89,DBLP:journals/pacmhci/LittLKH22}, tree-structured data). 
They can also differ in how they identify locations within the data (e.g. by using numeric offsets~\cite{DBLP:conf/sigmod/EllisG89}, unique identifiers, or paths through a tree).
Finally, patch languages differ in which specific actions are supported explicitly. Insertion and deletion are common, while code relocation, copying, undo, and other operations are variously also included.

In this paper, our focus was on syntax trees with holes (i.e. program sketches~\cite{DBLP:conf/aplas/Solar-Lezama09, DBLP:conf/popl/OmarVHAH17}) and explicit conflicts, which we represented as directed graphs. We identify locations using unique IDs. We have a two-level patch language, with a low-level graph patch language supporting only edge insertion and deletion and a higher-level user edit action language focused on insertion, deletion, and relocation, with some additional narrative consideration of copying and undo (a fuller account of which we leave to future work).  Our user edit language therefore forms a structure editor calculus, inspired closely by recent work on the Hazelnut structure editor calculus (which did not support relocation)~\cite{DBLP:conf/popl/OmarVHAH17} and patch languages for other tree-based data structures~\cite{DBLP:conf/sigmod/ChawatheG97, DBLP:journals/tse/FluriWPG07,DBLP:conf/kbse/FalleriMBMM14,DBLP:conf/doceng/Lindholm04,DBLP:conf/fase/NguyenNPN10,DBLP:journals/scp/SchwagerlUW15}.

\subsection{Patch Synthesis}
The most common approach to patch synthesis is to use a differencing algorithm to compare two states, e.g. from the file system, to generate a patch. 
The classic \li{diff} algorithm~\cite{DiffAlgorithm}, for example, minimizes edit distance for a patch language involving line insertions and deletions.

In the setting of tree-based editing, there have been a number of tree differencing algorithms described in the literature \cite{DBLP:conf/esa/Klein98,DBLP:journals/tcs/Bille05,DBLP:journals/talg/DemaineMRW09,DBLP:journals/fuin/AratsuHK10,DBLP:conf/sigmod/ChawatheG97, DBLP:journals/tse/FluriWPG07,DBLP:conf/kbse/FalleriMBMM14,DBLP:conf/doceng/Lindholm04,DBLP:conf/fase/NguyenNPN10,DBLP:journals/scp/SchwagerlUW15}. 
As described in \autoref{sec:Introduction}, synthesizing insertions and deletions is well-understood, but synthesizing relocations is more complex and requires heuristics.

The approach we explore in this paper is far simpler: we directly translate from the log of user edit actions to graph patches, without needing a differencing algorithm at all. This is only possible with a structure editor integrated with the version control system, but the benefit of direct visibility into the edit action log is that we do not need heuristics to synthesize relocations.

\subsection{Merging}
\subsubsection{Operational Transforms}
The most common approach to merging concurrently developed patches is to deploy an operational transform~\cite{DBLP:conf/sigmod/EllisG89} whereby locations in a remote patch are modified based on the action of a local patch. Standard three-way merge algorithms in version control systems deploy this approach, as do real-time collaborative editors. There have been a number of papers studying the algebraic properties of merging patches in this style. 

For example, the Darcs~\cite{DBLP:conf/haskell/Roundy05} version control system, like Grove, represents repositories using sets of patches. Using operational transforms, Darcs achieves commutativity in many cases, but not between conflicting patches. The theory of Darcs defines and algebraically characterizes when operational transforms do satisfy the properties of associativity and commutativity. Recent work on homotopical patch theory \cite{DBLP:journals/jfp/AngiuliMLH16} has similarly developed an abstract algebraic framework for distinguishing sensible merges. 

\subsubsection{CRDTs}

The observation that commutativity is a particularly helpful property when dealing with concurrent systems, including version control systems, has led to the development of a number of data structures centered on commutativity. These are known as CRDTs, which stands variously for \emph{conflict-free}, \emph{convergent} (CvRDT), or \emph{commutative replicated datatypes} (CmRDT) depending on particular details about the operations and the state representation~\cite{shapiro2011conflict}.
Our approach draws directly from this line of work: the Grove patch language forms a CmRDT on directed graphs, from which we observe that we can derive a CmRDT for trees with explicit conflicts.

Other examples of CRDT-based editors include and Peritext~\cite{DBLP:journals/pacmhci/LittLKH22} and Zed~\cite{zed-blog}. These systems differ from Grove by targeting synchronous editing rather than version control and by operating on sequential text rather than tree structures.

There have been other recent efforts to develop CmRDTs for tree data structures~\cite{DBLP:conf/icdcs/PreguicaMSL09, Highly-Available}. However, the focus in this work has been on avoiding conflicts and cycles entirely by applying \emph{ad hoc} heuristics for conflict resolution at merge-time, e.g. using reported timestamps or favoring particular directions in the tree. Our approach instead embraces manual conflict resolution, as is common practice in software projects where arbitrarily losing code is not acceptable. 

% Zed is a Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that reasons text edits using CRDTs and differs in approach by using Lamport timestamps to order events across replicas. Peritext, on the other hand, is a character based CRDT editor but is limited to the realm of rich-text editing.

Pijul iterates on the patch based system of Darcs, obtaining commutativity between conflicting patches using a CRDT graph data structure~\cite{pijul-talk}. Pijul's graph data structure is very similar to that of Grove in its treatment of edges, but, unlike Grove, requires vertices to be created before they can be referred to. This imposes a dependency relation between patches, causing Pijul to fall short of the full commutativity enjoyed by Grove.
Pijul is also language agnostic and models only the linear structure of text. However, Pijul goes beyond this version of Grove by extending the data structure to support history and branches, and Grove may be similarly extended in future work.
