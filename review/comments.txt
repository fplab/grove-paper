Review A

* L48 ‘an type’ -> a type
* L107 ‘a parent-child relationships’ -> a parent-child relationship
* L185 ‘Section 2.3-2.4 then describes’ -> Sections 2.3--2.4 then describe
* L525 ‘A location $\ell = (v, p) \in \mathcal L$, represents […]’: delete the comma
* L527 ‘An edge $\varepsilon{=}(w, \ell, v)$ […]’: need some space around the equal sign
* L541–542 ‘edges can only be created if they do not already exist’: I think we also have ${+} \sqcup {+}  = {+}$, which means already created edges can technically be ‘created’ again (although the effect is a no-op)?
* L589–590 (and throughout the paper) ‘Term’, ’ChildTerm’, ‘arity’, etc: These should be enclosed in `\mathit` to make the spacing correct.
* L645 ‘decomposittion’ -> decomposition
* L669 ‘the function decompVertex a term […]’: probably insert ‘that returns’ after ‘decompVertex’
* L746 Definition 3.17: probably missing a union operator
* L797 ‘zippered terms’: probably just ‘zipper terms’ (like in the next sentence)?
* L831 ‘Section 3.1 or Section 3.2.1’ -> Section 3.1, Section 3.2.1
* L871 ‘of ??’
* L881 ‘which is displayed a graph visualization […]’: probably delete ‘displayed’
* L905–911: Why so many paragraphs?
* L964 ‘[?]’
* L1004 (and similarly L1005) ‘child types’ -> child types $\bar\tau$
* L1051 ‘edge-ID(w)’: insert a space before the left parenthesis
* L1051 ‘w’, ‘u’ -> `$w$`, `$u$`
* L1145–1146: This paragraph is too sketchy.
* L1149 ‘many of different designs’ -> many different designs
* L1159 ‘low level’ -> low-level
* L1164 ‘[5, 9, 10, 16, 18, 25]’: This paragraph doesn’t really provide a comparison with the cited works.
* L1238: Dunfield and Krishnaswami have published their paper in ACM Computing Surveys (https://doi.org/10.1145/3450952).

Review B

*Nitpicks*
Line 48: "renames an type" should be "renames a type."
Line 879: "editor environment between 2 users" should be "editor environment between two users"


Review C

Details:

Section 2.3.2 It is well known that tree-based editors handle the granularity problem
better than line-based. But the tree-based editor has a much higher complexity, building
the tree and maintaining the correct tree structure during edits such as cut and paste.

Section 2.3.3 Grove chooses to silently merge changes from relocation modification, 
which current versioning control systems often yield a merge conflict. However, it
is hard to say that this behavior is always wanted or preferred. In many scenarios, 
the involved programmers may want to review before such merges are committed. Also, 
this example seems to work well because the operations involved, + and *, are 
commutative. What if we have operations like - and /?

Figure 10(d), why not add an L edge from +8 to *2 and a R edge from +8 to *24?
Also, why R31 and not R35 and L33 not L37?

What is the connection between Line 367 and Line 531? Earlier it says a disconnected
term may be connected back after a deletion but later it says deleted edges can't
connect again. Also, since an edge includes a term, the deletion of the edge also
causes the deletion of the term if it is connected to by only one edge. 

In Rule MKSLocalConflict, it is possible to synthesize a more precise type than ?.
A more meaningful choice is the least upper bound of all $\sigma_i$s in terms of
some subtyping relation. For example, if all branches of a conflict have Int, then
it is fine to say that the conflict has the type Int.

In rules MALocalConflict, MARelationConflict, and MAUnicycleConflict, why do you
generate a constraint between a ? and $\sigma$? In gradual typing, such constraints
are simply dropped. Probably you want to use the location for provenance. However,
it is unclear how the location associated with each ? is used.

Typos:

Line 48, a type

Line 68, initial and final states

Lines 91-92, Grove can do this because it explicitly carries conflicts

Line 163, what does "this work" refer to? Probably it refers to Hazelnut and Hazel,
but it is good to be explicit

Line 230, the paper uses odd numbers for edges and even numbers for vertices

Line 334, u*y should be u*v

Lines 431-432, two many "like these" make the sentence hard to understand

Definitions 3.4 and 3.5, a vertex *v* is an ..., otherwise v in the parentheses is unbound

Lemma 3.8, I am not sure if this is actually correct. For example *24 in Figure 9(d)
is both an MP and a U root.

Line 871, ??, missing reference
