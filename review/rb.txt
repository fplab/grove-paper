Paper summary
-------------
This paper describes an approach to resolving version control merge conflicts in structure editing contexts.  The work centers on two core ideas: (1) Eliminating standard differencing algorithms by using the history of user edit actions to directly produce graph patches (in part by switching from using unparsed text as the core representation to using representations of multiple syntax trees–groves–as the core representation).  (2)  Building on the marked lambda calculus (and bidirectional type checking more broadly) to handle cases where merge conflicts produce conflicting types; in particular, adding: gradual typing, hole filling, and solution suggestions (with the goal of making the programmer’s editor/tooling useful even during conflict resolution, in contrast to the “<<<<” approach that makes programs unparseable and thus removes tooling support).

Comments for authors
--------------------
This was a lovely, lovely read and a beautiful set of ideas.  I appreciated the clear writeup and the extremely useful concrete examples.  The motivation was very strong.  The core ideas of the multi-graph and how to represent conflicts explicitly is very compelling.

This was the first time I’ve seen anything tackling this space–it’s always exciting to see new problem statements!

My only (very minor) complaint is that as somewhat of an outsider to this space, I would have appreciated a longer and more detailed related works section, just to understand more about how the core ideas fit into the broader space.  This is not a demand for a longer Related Works–I think the section is clearly already sufficient for acceptance.  I only mention this because I think the paper could make a stronger case for its core ideas by offering a deeper analysis of the research space, especially for readers who are not already familiar with the relevant areas.

Overall, a very nice contribution!

*Nitpicks*
Line 48: "renames an type" should be "renames a type."
Line 879: "editor environment between 2 users" should be "editor environment between two users"
