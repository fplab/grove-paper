Sensibility -- mapping back from graphs
to well-typed states that fixes holes

TODO: somewhere in here, maybe multiple places, we want to talk about typing the intermediate states that arise (background for structured editing)

editor states:

conflicts (multiple children in the same spot)

multi-parent

cycles

non-empty holes

----------------

User must supply edge selection for multi-parent
